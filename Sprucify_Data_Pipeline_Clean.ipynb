        "I went in for a beard trim and was a little disappointed with my experience. This was my first formal beard trim so I was nervous and had a lot of questions through the process. The experience was nothing like a haircut with a consultation. My stylist, Mike, didn't ask what I wanted and just started trimming away based on what he thought. When I was asking questions about what he was doing and how I should care for my beard he acted as if I this wasn't part of the service. He even mentioned that he was talking too much and was booked after my appointment and it was taking too long. Not a good answer and not my problem. It took me a long time to grow it out, so yes I am very particular. In the end, it took some time to get used to the trim but I would've expected more of a consultation before just taking my beard into his own hands without my input. Maybe I would still have some of the hair in the areas I wanted to style a certain way (mustache) but its too late now though because it's trimmed off and in the trash.Make sure you tell them what you want or you may be at their mercy and their style., \n",

Before i combed my hair over, i noticed multiple strands and clumps of hair that he completely missed, and 1-2 inches longer than the rest. Luckily i dont wear my hear straight down in my face (like Floyd from Dumb &amp; Dumber), so a quick fix with scissors and a comb made this less noticeable. However, i shouldn't be cutting my own hair after paying $40. perhaps this occurred because cutting my hair seemed to be the last thing on his mind. i understand he's the owner/manager, but managing the shop &amp; employees shouldn't be his concern when cutting customers' hair. either do one or the other., \n",

I book my appointment easily online with Shorty (the owner). It wasn't until then I realized all the publications he is actually been written up in. I was somewhat skeptical yet excited. Shorty and I had a great conversations, enjoyed a little whiskey and some beer and I left with possibly the best haircut I have ever received! That's no joke keeping it real. This will be my tradition to come back to Shorty and JP Kempt every single time I'm in SF. Luckily for me it's quite often., \n",

I have gotta say that he and this place is worth every bit of the whopping $40 I paid for a simple cut which I was pretty on edge about spending, but I figured I would give it a shot since its been awhile since I've been to a legit barber. You gotta remember that you're paying a professional after all and you're also paying for the experience of it all. One thing when I got there though was when I was waiting they offered me a beer, this is completely new to me for just getting a haircut, and from what I have been seeing on yelp lately is that this is a new thing in barber shops. Louise was very good and very talkative. By talkative I don't mean any of that awkward SuperCuts small talk style, an actual conversation!Now DO NOT EXPECT TO BE IN-N-OUT QUICK! They are for the most part appointment only and do walk-ins when they have a cancellation or are just slow for the day which is rare. This morning I woke up and decided to get a haircut around 10:30-11:00AM and made my appointment around 11:30-12:00. The earliest available for today was at 2:30PM which was fine and worked for me ( I think I got lucky honestly). Checked in at around 2:20PM and waited for Louise to finish up a customer in front of me which took him till around 2:45 which was fine. Told Louise what I usually get and what I kind of wanted but for him to do what he thought was best for my short hair. This process with an actual conversation, information about the shop and products, and finally payment took around 45 to an hour. Louise definitely knew his stuff and how to properly cut hair for which he said he had a passion for and that he's been doing it since he was a kid which was a nice relief. So my final review gets a deserving 5-stars, heres the breakdown! Stars:5- Customer Service5- Experience5- Ambiance 5- Quality of Work, \n",

My cut was so bad that the second my girlfriend saw me, she asked me if I had let a five year old cut my hair.Do not go here unless you want to pay an amateur $70 to hack away at your neck with a razor blade and attack your hair with scissors while wearing a blindfold., \n",

        "San Francisco is not a barbershop town. The experience mostly ranges from pretentious to crappy. And after a terrible experience at two different barber shops in the city, I reluctantly turned to Yelp where I found the folks at JP Kempt. A few thoughts: \u00a01. Painless online reservations: For starters, JP Kempt, have a simple online reservation system that means you don't have to waste time on a phone. It's super-easy to book an appointment with the barber you wanted and fast. \n",

Friendly Customer Service: Unlike the other two barbershops (that shall remain nameless), the user experience was very pleasant, both on the phone (when they called to remind) and in person. As other commenters have mentioned, they also offer you a choice of beverage while you wait. Nice touch. 3. The Haircut: But none of the above would work if the haircut doesn't, but Shorty is pleasant, smart, and knowledgeable. Gave me the quickest haircut I was looking for, a lil shorter than I'd have liked, but the key to your regular barber is that you've got to work with them as they fine tune a haircut that works just for you. I liked the total experience and look forward to nailing that ideal haircut in the weeks to come. Definitely recommend checking it out., \n",

It's $40 here and you get a free beer or whiskey and the atmosphere is perfect, just vintage enough to be hip without going overboard and becoming pretentious.

There were about five or six other men getting haircuts and shaves and I didn't mind waiting for my appointment time because I was intrigued with watching the barbers execute their mastery skills.Jourdan was able to bump me up an appointment slot and asked me what I wanted done. Having seen her work before, I told her that she had complete freedom to do what she thought would look good. She suggested a #2 fade as I had not had anything shorter than a 2 in the past. The half hour went by so quickly as we chatted and she gave me what my fianc\u00e9e and I agree is the best haircut I've ever had.

What I MEANT to say was \"as low as possible with sheers\", but through some mind mix-up it did not come out correctly. He took to me with the clippers and it took me a moment to realize he wasn't taking of some sideburn but rather taking that shit DOWN, all of it. I stopped him and explained the error I had made - at first I think he expected me to say he had made an error, but I completely realized what I had said and that it was all on me. We laughed and moved on and he promised to make it look good, and he came through in every way. The cut was fantastic and his attention to detail and quality was admirable. I will certainly be returning and would recommend this barber shop to anyone in the area (or even across the bay). David did a killer job with my \"playboy\" cut, and I'm sure the rest of the staff are top of the line as well.

        "My family moved too far to keep going to my son's regular barber, and he absolutely HATES getting his hair cut. He is mixed-race white and Black, and he has this hair that is frizzy in some places, kinky in others, silky-curly along the edges, and then a mixture of all those in places...While searching for another place, we went to two shops that gave horrible haircuts from people who had no idea how to work with his hair. By the time i called JP Kempt we had both kind of given up. My son walked into that shop with his hair like a rat's nest, throwing me attitude both poisonous and magnificient since i had gotten him after school and taken him away from his friends, with whom he was about to go play Minecraft. There was murder in my heart when we walked into the shop, let me tell you; and although i loved the old-timey decor of the place and the punk rock playing on the sound system i did have reservations about whether such a hipsteresque locale would have someone savvy to my boy's particular hair needs. When the sympathetic young blond woman stylist (Jordan, her name was) offered me \"water, soda, beer or whiskey\" before i sat down to wait, i thought she was making a joke to lighten my mood. \"No, she says, \"We really have beer and whiskey. Yes, it's for free. Well, actually we're out of whiskey, but would you like a glass of beer?\" The beer was dark and slightly hoppy, and cold. For FREE. Deee-licious. Then, with my mood restored, i sat down and had a lovely amusing conversation with a sleeved and bearded (but well-kempt) barber and the guy at the front desk who booked my appointment, a fella who used to run Cobb's Comedy Club and who looked eerily like Teddy Roosevelt, curly moustache and all. The owner, Shorty, was cutting in the front chair with a pair of antique hand-powered clippers that everyone agreed woould give any stylist \"Popeye arms\" with regular use. The clientele was comfortably unpretentious, both young fellas getting their trims and fades cleaned up and older dudes, including the blond lady stylist's dad.Curly moustache Teddy told me that Shorty, the proprietor, had been one of the original dudes to start the first F.S.C. Barber barbershop in New York. I am aware there is another FSC in the city now, but my son and i are not fancy; JP Kempt had the retro look that i and others (including my kid) find attractive, but at JP the retro goes to the attitude as well; a working-class lack of fussy in both barbers and clientele that set us right at ease the minute we walked through the door.Now, the haircut: F*&amp;king WORK OF ART. I was so afraid that my son would not get someone who could cut Black hair. We got LUIS. ASK FOR LUIS. He is a superstar. My son's 'fro was so perfect, i immediately whipped out my phone and started Instagramming. My boy even forgot to give me 'tude, he was so pleased with the result. I NEVER tip more than $5, to the point where i brought only $5 cash, but i put another $5 on my debit card when i paid the front guy. The haircut was so good, i have a little crush on Luis now *blush*.A barbershop, a real barbershop, should not be a salon and should DEFINITELY not be a boutique. JP Kempt is the REAL DEAL.

However in a pinch, I would easily trust any member of his fine staff to jump in and clean me up.Do yourself a favor guys, book an apt for a shave and a haircut and enjoy, you won't be sorry you did!, \n",

        "SHORTLY IS TREMENDO BARBERO! Finding a good barber for me has been a long journey in the last three years. In the past, I had an excellent \u00a0barber for 8 years who I had lo let go. He moved away from SF. Afterwards, during the last three years, I had gone from barber shop to barber shop in the city of San Francisco. I went to to Barber Fellow but only for a short while. Among other things, this place was the most difficult barber shop to book a hair cut. Besides that, I demand quality. If I am going to pay $ 40 for a barber cut, It better be good and stress free right? Well, not always. I tell you folks, based on my painful experience, just because there is a high price to pay \u00a0it means is worth it. However, there is a tight with quality and value. Shortly, the owner of the shop, not only \u00a0knows the essence of business. He certainly shows his passion with pride in the outstanding performance \u00a0of his cuts. They are timeless, precised, and with direction. Perhaps I have high standards. In fact, I have high standards. Not just for a good barber but also for a good dentist, a good mechanic, a \u00a0good specialized instructor etc...and that is business; the ability to trade an asset, such as money, for goods and services. Thank you Shortly!~Marty Covault~, \n",

I was greeted at the front desk by a very kind fella who offered me a beer while the barber got his station setup, killer! The vibe in the shop is all time! Very authentic traditional barber shop feel, which is what I look for and is truly hard to find these days. All the barbers there were very professional, but were smiling, laughing and socializing with their clients. You can tell every individual working there is extremely skilled and passionate about what they do. I only went for a trim, but they offer everything from barber facials to straight razor shaves and everything in between. I was beyond happy with my trim and you can't beat the hot lather and straight razor cleanup on the neck area and hot moist towel cleanup at the end! Lastly, the fact that every person that left while I was there had a huge smile on their face speaks wonders. Thanks to everyone in the shop, finally found my go-to barber shop!, \n",
